The interactive parts are all already built for you! You just need to convert them from buttons into using steps.




When I say the graphic should "always stay the same ratio," I mean it should always be the same shape, no matter what size the window gets. So if by default it's 700x400, if I made my window wide wide wide and it became 1400 pixels wide, it would be 800 pixels wide.



Yes, it's okay for it to "break" if you make the window shape especially weird.







Start with notes.txt from class, really, it's got a useful template for the responsive stuff in there. After you add that in it's just a game of figuring out what scales to fix and then redrawing what relies on those scales.












Make sure you're ALWAYS using newHeight and newWidth in your render function, not height and width! This is where 75% of your bugs will come from.














Pay attention to your console!








Do you have both an xAxis and a yAxis?











Those full-ticks are a little problematic. How did you set them to that size in the first place? It's going to be the same thing.













After you've redone your y axis, you can run svg.select('.y-axis .domain').remove() again to make the dark lines disappear, or you can add 

    #chart1 .y-axis .domain { display: none }

to your CSS
